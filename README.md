Our final research topic is analyzing the restaurants' data on locations, prices, ratings, and popular meals. We chose to research this because we wanted to investigate the accuracy of ratings of the restaurants online and see how the users will be affected by it. We made our variables within the data that were already proven and added restaurant locations and zip codes to specifically focus on the relationship between the variables. We will be answering questions about the most popular restaurants within the prices and locations to make the audiences make a better decision on choosing the restaurants. We have used DoorDash and Uber Eats as a reference, however, we used more data and variables to get more specific results for Doordash and Uber Eats users and people in general.
